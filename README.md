## DEVELOPER'S NOTE  <a name="paragraph3"></a>
<img width="100" height="100" src="devloper.jpg" align="left"> Hello World !! I am Suraj Kumar, a CSE undergraduate and a passionate full-stack developer. Well the pain of B.Tech students coming to boring lectures for attendance and professers not willing to take one for such a large number of students had motivated me for this one stop solution. This is how my journey with MUSR has started and I look forward to people joining me with their valuable suggestions.
